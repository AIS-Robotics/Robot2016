## Important
> Just something to note. There is a change mode button on the controller that changes how the DPAD and left joystick are read (it switches them). You can tell if the mode is switched if the LED on the controller is on.
When driving make sure this is off at all times to prevent catastrophic bugs or unexpected actions.
